## Chapter 1: Introduction


Known as the "language of the web" because it is used in the development of an incredibly high number of applications on the web and the mobile paradigm alike. 

It is the language which makes web applications dynamic so that users can interact with them, wich provides a rich user experience.

When JavaScript came into existence around 1995, most of the logical calculations and input validations in web pages were primarily donde using server-side languafes like PHP. 

The process was very long and unnecessarily involved two-way trips, first to end a request to the server and the get the data/error back to the client's computer. It was a huge letdown to UX. The need of that time was to make validations right on the client's computer before sending to the server, thereby reducing the bandwidth, which at that time was a major issue so that the user would not have to wait just to see if he made any errors while typing out that form.

JavaScript was created by Brendan Eich as "LiveScript" in 1995, wich got rnamed to "JavaScript." It was initially named "Mocha" but named JavaScript to gain traction with the language Java that was getting popular at the same time. The first major standarization courred in the form of ECMA standarization. The fist version developed still lacked features like RGEX ans JSON and some important built-in functions. The language kept getting developed and adding features to its repertoire.

It was the ECMA v3 that saw the birth of AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML), wich today is at the core of every web application framework.

At present, the language is packed with exciting new features. Let's look at the advantges one gets with JavaScript:

- JavaScript is a lightweight, interpreted programming language.

- Designed for creating simple as well as complex web applications.

- Furthers the functionality of web pages.

- Animation and Visual effects can be done easily

- UI/UX improvements

Owning to the language's success and usability, many frameworks and libraries like jQuery, Angular JS, React JS have been developed wich make writing code in JavaScript a delight.

JavaScript is the scripting language that is being actively used by developers around the globe in creating interactive, functional and animated by the use of this language as a scripting tool.

JavaScript began as a client-side scripting language but is being used on the backend side of the web also in the form of Node.js. Many libraries and frameworks have sprung up in the meantime to make the developer's life easy.

JavaScript has built-in as well as user defined methods/functions that allow themsselves to get bound to certain buttons  or elements and can be called whenever and wherever. The functions are being actively used to automate tasks like the setTimeout() or setInterval() functions that can be called aftter a certain period of time to do dome task. 

JavaScript can be used in the HTML file itself, if it is written into the <!-- <script></script> --> tags, and can also be attached to it as an external file. The extension of a JavaScript program is '.js.'

JavaScript is often abbreviated as JS. Some of the main features of the language are as follows:

- High-level, Weakly Typed
- Interpreted
- Functional
- Object-Oriented

Object-Oriented design is perhaps the most important feature of JavaScript, as it allows us the creation of objects and establishes relationships between them, commonly know as Inheritance and Encapsulation, which you'll come to know about in the proceeding chapters.

## Chapter 2: Main features of JavaScript

Most of the features of JavaScript are more or less same as that of other common programming languages. Almost all the programming languages have these features. The main features are as follows.

1. JavaScript Variables

One of the very important of JavaScript is variables. They act as the storage containers for values. In other words, they are the names of the memory locations at which the values are stored.

These values can be an integer, decimal values, strings or single characters. The variable names have to be unique. 

This is important because otherwise, this will create a great amout of confusion. The name of the variable can start from an alphabet, dollar sign or underscore signs.

The names are case-sensitive. You will get to know exact rules for naming a variable in the later chapter.

Examples of some varibales are:

var abcd:

var $abc;
